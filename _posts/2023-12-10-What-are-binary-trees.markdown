Binary trees can be thought of as a pointer-based data structure which resemble a tree. They have a root node, which can be thought of as the entry point into the tree. The root node has no parent. 

Each node contains a value, as well as a left and right pointer. Child nodes also have a parent pointer. The leaf nodes do not have left and right pointers.   

See the image below for an example of a binary tree:

You can go from the root node to any other node in the tree in O(logn) traversals. 

Depth: How many pointers must I follow to get to a certain node. Can be thought of as the number
of edges from X upto the root node. The root node has a depth of 0.  
Height: The height of a node is the number of edges on the longest path from the node to a leaf node. 
The leaf node has a height of 0. 

Note: N = total # of nodes in BST

Time Complexities: 
 Searching: O(logn)

 Insertion: 
 0(n) (worst case)
  - Note: The tree has to be either skewed to the right or the left.  

 O(1) (best case)
  - Note: this occurs when the tree is skewed to the right, and the node being inserted belongs to the 
  left subtree (or vice versa). 
 
 **TODO -- Look into code samples of this ~ Deletion:
  - Deleting a node involves a few different cases: 
    - A) Node to be deleted is a leaf node 
    - B) Node to be deleted has 1 child 
      - Make the parents point to the child instead of the node to be deleted 
    - C) Node to be deleted has 2 children 
      - Find the minimum node on the right sub-tree and copy that value in the targeted node. Then, 
      delete the duplicate from the right sub-tree 
      - Find the maximum node on the left sub-tree and copy that value in the targeted node. Then, 
      delete the duplicate from the left sub-tree

#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
